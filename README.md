This is an experimental project and it is my first github repository, i've decided to put it here just in case it gets lost lol.
I would be very happy to answer any questions about this project, feedback is appreciated too!

How this website works:
  It is a social-media-like website, where there is divs that act like accounts that you are friends with, which you can show the 'chat box' thing by clicking anywhere on the account (except for the account buttons).
  Clicking on the "Message User" button changes the status of every account based on the current *functionIndex*.
  It lacks a lot of stuff, but it's an experimental project so expect everything lol.
